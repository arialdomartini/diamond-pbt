Print Diamond Kata
==================

Implementation of the [Print Diamond Kata](https://blog.cyber-dojo.org/2014/10/breaking-down-problem.html)
with [Property-Based Testing](https://arialdomartini.github.io/property-testing).

Ideally, the implementation should be done:

- incrementally activating one test after the other;
- at each step, implementing the bare minumum code to let the test
  pass.
  
This exercise should help figuring out if TDD with Property-Based
Tests can induce an emerging design.

## Build
Run tests:

```bash
dotnet test
```
